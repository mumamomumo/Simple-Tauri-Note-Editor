This is a simple note editor app that I made while trying to learn how to make apps using Tauri and React. The way I did was probably horrible, but at least I got it working :D

I used ReactTS with Tauri and Vite, along with other tools like TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui. I used Zustand as the state manager

I'm not good at making UI so that's why it probably doesn't look that good. It was difficult for me to make this since it was my first time working with a JavaScript framework, and I don't even have much experience using JavaScript either, plus I used TypeScript.
